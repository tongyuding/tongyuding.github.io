I will work as a Research Assistant at the City University of Hong Kong from August 2022, supervised by [Prof. Qing Ke](https://qke.github.io/). My research focuses on data science and database.

Prior to Cityu, I worked in [Nanjing Catinfo](https://www.catinfo.cn/) with Keqin Shen and Wei Wang.

Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss the research, even the philosophy.
